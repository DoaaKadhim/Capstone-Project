# Capstone-Project
# Student Dashboard Application

## Overview

The **Student Dashboard Application** is a web-based interface designed to provide students with an overview of their academic progress. It includes information about enrolled courses, completed quizzes, pending assignments, and comments. Users can navigate to different sections like viewing courses, taking quizzes, and joining virtual classrooms. The application interacts with `localStorage` to fetch and display student-specific data.

## Features

- **Dashboard Summary**: Provides an overview of student progress including enrolled courses, completed quizzes, and pending assignments.
- **Quick Links**: Access key student actions like viewing courses, taking quizzes, and joining virtual classrooms.

- **Comments**: Displays user comments that have been added, allowing users to view, add, and manage their comments in the dashboard. Users can also delete comments and the updates are persistent across page reloads.

- **Persistent Data**: Uses `localStorage` to store and retrieve user data (courses, quizzes, assignments).
